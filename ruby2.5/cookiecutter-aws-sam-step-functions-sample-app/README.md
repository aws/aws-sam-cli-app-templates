# Cookiecutter Ruby Step Functions Sample App (Stock Trader) for SAM based Serverless App

A cookiecutter template to create a Ruby Step Functions Sample App (Stock Trader) boilerplate using [Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model).

This application creates a mock stock trading workflow which runs on a pre-defined schedule. It demonstrates the power of Step Functions to orchestrate Lambda functions and other AWS resources to form complex and robust workflows, coupled with event-driven development using Amazon EventBridge.

## Requirements

* [AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)

## Usage

Generate a boilerplate template in your current project directory using the following syntax:

* **Ruby 2.5**: `sam init --runtime ruby2.5`

> **NOTE**: ``--name`` allows you to specify a different project folder name (`sam-app` is the default)
